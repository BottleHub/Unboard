# Unboard

## What's This?

This is just an implementation of the [Unboard](https://github.com/bottlehub/Unboard) social feature in [BottleHub](https://github.com/bottlehub/bottlehub). It is designed to test out the safety and ease of use of the secure social network system we at the team are developing.

This is the original implementation, feel free to fork it and use it with any framework you want. We'll list them here as community adaptations.

If you find any bugs, raise an issue we'll try our best to solve it. You could also create a pull request if you find the time to, we'll review it and merge where and when necessary.
