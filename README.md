# Unboard

## What's This?

This is just an implementation of the [Unboard](https://github.com/bottlehub/Unboard) social feature in [BottleHub](https://github.com/bottlehub/bottlehub). It is designed to test out the safety and ease of use of the secure social network system we at the team are developing.

We believe in freedom and security that's why we're providing the source code separately, which we'll be providing an implementation in the frontend through [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com) via [Apollo](https://), as well frameworks soon.

This is the original implementation, feel free to fork it and use it with any framework you want. We'll list them here as community adaptations.

We also aim to implement it with [Flutter](https://) in the future, so just stand by or as we said earlier fork it, it's free, we'll also contribute to your repository if you don't mind.

If you find any bugs, raise an issue we'll try our best to solve it. You could also create a pull request if you find the time to, we'll review it and merge where and when necessary.
